## 0.0.1 (2024-02-25)
### New
- Added initial files.
- Added `Tolgee` class to provide access to the Tolgee SDK methods.
- Added `TranslationText` and `TranslationWidget` widgets.
- Added `Tolgee.init` method to initialize the Tolgee SDK using either the dynamic or static mode. In the dynamic mode, the SDK fetches the translations from the Tolgee platform. In the static mode, the translations are loaded from the local assets.
